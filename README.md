# ArchSetup

This repository contains scripts for configuring a GNOME based Arch Linux setup.

# Usage

Get a bootable USB Arch Linux installer https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/installation_guide

Run the `archinstall` and walk through the setup, or manually set up a bare-bones Arch GNOME install

Boot the OS and run

`sudo pacman -S git`

`git clone git@github.com:FyorDev/ArchSetup.git`

`cd ./ArchSetup`

`sudo install.sh`

If, next to my setup, you also want to install the software that I use. Run `sudo install.sh -s`
